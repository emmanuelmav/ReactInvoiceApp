### What I learned

I just successfully built a full-stack application using React, MongoDB, Express, and Node.js. Throughout this project, I learned numerous skills and techniques that are essential to becoming a proficient full-stack developer. Firstly, I gained a deep understanding of how to use React, a popular front-end JavaScript library, to build interactive and responsive user interfaces. Secondly, I now know how to use MongoDB, a flexible and scalable NoSQL database, to store and retrieve data. Thirdly, I learned how to use Express, a lightweight web framework, and Node.js, a server-side JavaScript environment, to build robust and scalable back-end services. Lastly, I honed my skills in debugging, testing, and deployment, essential for delivering high-quality and bug-free software. Overall, building a full-stack application allowed me to see the entire development process, from design to production, giving me valuable experience that will benefit me in my future projects.

### Continued development

I would like to work on form validation alot more and get more comfrotable using React Router.

### Useful resources

- [React Router Tutorial](https://youtu.be/Ul3y1LXxzdU) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Mongoose Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZBGEVgL2eE) - This is an amazing video which helped me finally understand Mongoose. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
