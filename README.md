### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

I would like to work on form validation alot more and get more comfrotable using React Router.

### Useful resources

- [React Router Tutorial](https://youtu.be/Ul3y1LXxzdU) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Mongoose Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZBGEVgL2eE) - This is an amazing video which helped me finally understand Mongoose. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
